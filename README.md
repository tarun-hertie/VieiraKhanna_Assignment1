# 1st Assignment by Camila and Tarun
#
##This is the README file for the first assignment due on 7th October 2016.
###We use R to analyse two datasets retrieved from [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) repo. The 'data_download' file contains the source code for accessing the data. The Assign1_analysis is the Rmarkdown file that contains the actual analysis. Both the files are dynamically linked. 
#
###The first analysis is on: [Marriage Trends in the US](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/marriage)
###The second analysis is on: [World Alcohol Consumption Patterns](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption)

###We perform basic transformations on data and illustrate data's distribution using descriptive statistics.
